# predict-recall
A report by Ziya Xu and Grace Fujinaga

Thus far, much emphasis has been placed on developing subject specific machine learning models to predict recall. However, a successful generalized model for predicting recall could prove key for the development of brain stimulation devices. We have demonstrated that such a generalized model trained on data from the power spectral analysis of scalp EEG electrodes is possible, and the best performing models are logistic regression and Gaussian naive Bayes. However, model performance was limited by the low dimensionality of the dataset as many electrode recordings were removed to ensure consistent features across subjects. Future experiments that emphasize consistent electrode placements could result in improved performance of general recall prediction models.
